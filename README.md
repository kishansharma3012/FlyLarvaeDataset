# FlyLarvae dataset
A new data set of pixel-wise instance labeled soldier fly larvaes. [Download](https://github.com/kishansharma3012/FlyLarvae_dataset/blob/master/FlyLarvae_dataset.zip)

## Description
This dataset of soldier fly larvae, which are bred in massive quantities for sustainable, environment friendly organic waste decomposition [1,2]. Fly larvae images were collected using a Sony Cyber shot DSC-WX350 camera with image size 1380 X 925 pixels The camera is installed on a professional fixture to guarantee a fixed distance from camera to observation plane for all image acquisitions. This is important to avoid any scale variation between the different image acquisitions. Very large numbers of larvae mingled with a lot of larvae feed lead to high object overlap and occlusions. These similar looking brown colored fly larvaes have variations in their sizes and flexible structure. To simplify our tasks, we choose high contrast black color background. The images were collected by using one spoonful of larvaes weighting approximately 3-6 grams (~700-1900 Larvaes), uniformly scattered over the image area. All larvae instances are labeled pixel-wise.

## Properties
This dataset represent crowded scenario of similar looking fly larvaes. The size (pixel area covere) distribution histogram of fly larvae is shown in figure. This dataset consists of 10844 pixel-wise labeled fly larvaes.
